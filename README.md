# PortfolioProjects with SQL and Python
<p>Link may could help you to understand which resource I inspired : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM&ab_channel=AlexTheAnalyst</p>

In this portfolio project I will be preparing different analysis.

<b>Projects can be divided different steps. I consider setting 4 projects respectively such as:</b>

<p> Project 1)GOAL is: Using the basic SQL commands and finding answers to the questions that I created, analyzing a dataset with Basic SQL queries.</p>

<b> Functions that I used
* SELECT
* COUNT
* HAVING
* GROUP BY 
* ORDER BY
* CASE WHEN
* WHERE
* TIME FUNCTIONS</b>

<b>There are roughly 30 SQL queries to manipulate data by using FUNDAMENTAL SQL COMMANDS. You will find different concepts.</b>

<p>Project 2) Data exploration with SQL</p>

<b>Goal is : Data exploration and making some insights about COVID dataset, interpret it and conclude.</b>

<b> Functions that I used
* AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
* CAST
* CASE WHEN STATEMENTS
* JOIN 
* DATA DEFINITION COMMNANDS
* CREATING VIEW</b>


Project 3) Data Cleaning with SQL 

Main goal : Making data more useable, much more accurate and easy to understand.

<b> Functions that I used
* UPDATE
* CREATE
* CONVERT
* JOIN
* ISNULL
* STRING FUNCTIONS
* ROW_NUMBER
* DROP AND ALTER COMMANDS</b>


Project 4) Correlation with Python in Jupyter notebook


# ABOUT DATASETS

For the project 1, the dataset could be reached via link https://www.udemy.com/course/alistirmalarla-sql-ogreniyorum/. 

This dataset is about Car features. We will be using BASIC and MODERATE SQL level to manipulate this dataset.

For the project 2, the dataset could be reached via link:
https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&time=2020-03-01..latest&country=USA~GBR~CAN~DEU~ITA~IND&region=World&pickerMetric=location&pickerSort=asc&Interval=7-day+rolling+average&Align+outbreaks=false&Relative+to+Population=true&Metric=Confirmed+cases

It is totaly about COVID and vaccinations number during the COVID. So I did some data explorations to understand what is going on COVID cases and vaccinations for each country.

For the Cleaning Project the Dataset is Nashville Housing Dataset.
