# Making a PortfolioProject with SQL and Python
Link may could help you to understand what is going on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM&ab_channel=AlexTheAnalyst

In this portfolio project I will be preparing different analysis.

Projects can be divided different steps. I consider setting 4 projects respectively such as:

Project 1) Analyzing a dataset with Basic SQL queries

Project 2) Data exploration with SQL 

Project 3) Data Cleaning with SQL 

Project 4) Correlation with Python in Jupyter notebook


# ABOUT DATASETS

For the project 1, the dataset could be reached via link https://www.udemy.com/course/alistirmalarla-sql-ogreniyorum/. 

This dataset is about Car features. We will be using BASIC and MODERATE SQL level to manipulate this dataset.

For the project 2, the dataset could be reached via link:
https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&time=2020-03-01..latest&country=USA~GBR~CAN~DEU~ITA~IND&region=World&pickerMetric=location&pickerSort=asc&Interval=7-day+rolling+average&Align+outbreaks=false&Relative+to+Population=true&Metric=Confirmed+cases

It is totaly about COVID and vaccinations number during the COVID. So I did some data explorations to understand what is going on COVID cases and vaccinations for each country.
